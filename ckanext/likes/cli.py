# registered inside the group. Name of the command matches name of the function
# with underscores replaced by hyphens. You can pass string into `.command()`

# `click.argument` defines positional argument of the command. `click.option`
# defines optional flag with the specified short and long names.
#
# `click.pass_context` passes shared contex object to the command. Example
# below uses it to read data set by initialization code from group body.

# When printing something, always use `click.echo` for plain output and
# `click.secho` for styled(colored) output. Never use built-in `print`
# function. It's allowed to use logging, but most likely, you don't need and
# `click.echo` is much better choice.
